#Python Virtual Environment 

Create Virtual Environment in Python
We use a module named virtualenv which is a tool to create virtual environment Python, isolated from the system environment Python.

virtualenv creates a folder that contains all the executables necessary to use the packages that a Python project would need.

Installing virtualenv
$ pip install virtualenv
Test your installation:

$ virtualenv --version
Create Python Environment
You can create a virtualenv using the following command:

$ virtualenv my_env
After running this command, a directory named my_env will be created. This is the directory that contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.

This is where Python packages will be installed. If you want to specify the Python interpreter of your choice, for example, Python3, it can be done using the following command:

$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 virtualenv_name
